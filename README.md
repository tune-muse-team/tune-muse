# Tune Muse Application

A minimum viable application for suggesting music based on someone's preferences.

## Description

This application is the minimum viable product of a platform where human music curators can sell their expertise to music addicts to help them discover new songs they love. It will help you discover new songs you love according to what matters to you. This application was created to reach learning and evaluation objectives as part of a coding bootcamp from the University of Toronto.

## Installation

No installation necessary.

## Usage

To use this web application, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) to review the code and validate it meets the acceptance criteria. You can also take some time to discover new songs and enjoy them for the rest of your life. Each new discovery is saved in the local storage of your browser so you can find it again if necessary, by navigating back to the application.
